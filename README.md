# 👋 Hi there, I’m Andrada! 

I'm a 26-year-old coder, cat mom, and space enthusiast 🚀. Here’s a glimpse of what I’m all about:

- 🐈‍⬛ Proud cat mom (they do occasionally contribute to my code, but mostly through reviews).
- 🌌 Passionate about all things space - satellites, galaxies, and the tech that brings the universe closer!
- 👩‍💻 Developer and problem-solver, always looking to dive into new projects and learn something new.
